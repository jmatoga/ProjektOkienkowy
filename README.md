## General info
First student project written in C# and also first contact with this language and github. We wrote it together to develop soft skills of working in a group and we wanted to develop (previously we only wrote applications in C++).

The project involves drawing simple shapes (e.g. a circle, a triangle, a parallelogram) and complex shapes (combining simple shapes with each other). The user can choose whether he wants to display this shape in the console or in the GUI.
